### 6. Checking shape, data types and missing values

#### Observation
<p>There are 9 columns in the dataset. The data has the product name, and data about the customers who bought them. The customer data that is provided is about their age distribution, gender, education , whether they in a relationship, and how much their usage of the product is expected to be. Also included is fitness data, income and miles the customers expect to run or walk. </p>
<p> The shape of the data is 180 rows, 9 columns. 6 of the columns are int64, while 3 are objects. There are no missing values in the dataset.</p>

### 7. Descriptive statistics for the dataset

treadmillData.describe()

### Observation
<p>  The continous/numerical variables are: age, education, usage, fitness, income, miles.</p>
<ol>
   <li>The age range for the 180 customers was 18 to 50 years for the three treadmill products.</li>
    <li>The mean age for the customer was 28.7 years, and the median age was 26 years.</li>
    <li> The Inter-quartile range for age was approximately 9 years (75% - 25%).</li>
    <li>75% of the customers were below the age of 33 years.</li>
    <li> The income range for the 180 customers was approximately 29,000 dollars to 104,000 dollars.</li>
    <li> The mean income was approximately 53,719 dollars and the median income was 50,596 dollars.</li>
    <li> The mean and median usage (expected) was approximately 3 times per week. </li>
    <li> Overall, the 180 customers rated themselves on the fitness scale an average of 3.3. </li>
    <li> The average miles they expected to use the treadmill for was 103 miles. The units are not given for this column, but it can be interpreted to be per month (assuming a person walks for 3 miles a day).</li>
    </ol>

    #Descriptive statistics on categorical variables
productCount = pd.crosstab(index=treadmillCustomerData["Product"],columns="count")
productCount

### Observation
<p> TM195 product was sold the most (80 items). 60 items that were TM498 were sold. And 40 items that were TM798 were sold.</p>

#Descriptive statistics on categorical variables
genderCount = pd.crosstab(index=treadmillCustomerData["Gender"],columns="count")
genderCount

### Observations
<p> Among the 180 customers, 104 customers were male, while 76 were female. Hence, more male customers bought treadmills as compared to females in the given dataset.</p>

#Descriptive statistics on categorical variables
maritalStatusCount = pd.crosstab(index=treadmillCustomerData['MaritalStatus'],columns="count")
maritalStatusCount

![image](https://github.com/deevikram/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/assets/83994337/42d9fb78-7fb4-489b-82b2-a89d2d9326ed)

### Observations
<p> Among the 180 customers, 107 customers had a partner, while 73 were single. Hence, more partnered customers bought treadmills as compared to singles in the given dataset.</p>

#Descriptive statistics on variables
fitnessCount = pd.crosstab(index=treadmillCustomerData['Fitness'],columns="count")
fitnessCount

![image](https://github.com/deevikram/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/assets/83994337/bd12d670-6873-451f-b65c-0b919bec411b)

### Observations
<p> Among the 180 customers, 97 customers rated themselves as being on the middle of a fitness scale which had a range of 1 (poor shape) - 5 (excellent shape). Hence, we can conclude that people who rated themselves as fairly fit on a scale of 1 - 5 were the biggest chunk of customers who bought treadmills. </p>

### 8. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis for the dataset (observations are under each cell)

# Univariate analysis section
sns.histplot(data=treadmillCustomerData, x='Age', kde=True);
plt.show()#To display 2 graphs as the output of this cell

#Summary Statistics on 'Age' variable with respect to 'Gender'
sns.boxplot(treadmillCustomerData['Gender'],treadmillCustomerData['Age']);
plt.show()

![image](https://github.com/deevikram/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/assets/83994337/8bc8e7a4-52b5-4d81-97d5-928df95ccd54)

### Observations: 
<ol>
    <li>The mean and median are different for the frequency distribution of data for age of the customer. The distribution is slightly skewed to the right (positive skew). The tail is to the right, so less number of middle aged/older customers bought the treadmill products as compared to younger people. </li>
    <li>A large number of customers were around 25 years old. We can infer that young people bought treadmills more than middle-aged/older customers.</li>
    <li>Among the 180 customers, the distribution of age was fairly similar for males and females. There was one outlier point present for age among the female customers - i.e. the female who was aged 50 years old was outside the whiskers of the box plot, so that data point can be considered an outlier</li>

# Univariate analysis section
sns.histplot(data=treadmillCustomerData, x='Income', kde=True);
plt.show()#To display multiple graphs as the output of this cell

sns.histplot(data=treadmillCustomerData, x='Education', kde=True);
plt.show()

sns.histplot(data=treadmillCustomerData, x='Usage', kde=True);

### Observation
<p> Data is rightskewed for above variables. As income increases, the count goes lower. Similar observations can be made for education, fitness, miles and usage. </p>

#Bivariate analysis on age and income
sns.jointplot(treadmillCustomerData['Age'],treadmillCustomerData['Income']);

### Observations: 
<p>We can see the most of the customers are clustered around younger ages, and mostly under 70,000 dollars on the income side.</p>

#Bivariate Analysis
sns.lineplot(x='Fitness',y='Miles',data=treadmillCustomerData);

![image](https://github.com/deevikram/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/assets/83994337/f10cfda1-6bf6-4696-bdb4-b4a49ab8d549)

### Observations
<p> Fitness versus Miles was fairly straightforward relationship. The higher the people rated themselves on the fitness scale, the more the number of miles the customers expected to walk/run each week </p>

#Bivariate Analysis
sns.lineplot(x='Fitness',y='Usage',data=treadmillCustomerData);

### Observations
<p> Fitness versus Usage had a similar straightforward relationship. The higher the people rated themselves on the fitness scale, the more the number of times the customers expected to use the treadmills. </p>

#Analysis using both numerical and categorical variables
sns.pointplot(x='Fitness',y='Age',hue='Gender',data=treadmillCustomerData);

### Observations: 
<ol>
    <li>For fitness versus age, and categorized by gender in the first plot - we can see that females above the age of 30 happened to rate themselves low on the fitness scale, while males above the age of 30 did not. There is similar disagreement towards the other end of the fitness scale. However, both males and females around the mean and median age had a similar self-rating on the fitness scale.</li>
    <li>For fitness versus income, and categorized by gender in the second plot - both males and females with higher incomes rated themselves more fit.</li>

### Observations
<ol>
    <li>An interesting observation here is that people who rated themselves as above average fitness on the fitness scale (so fitness scale >3) were the customers who bought product TM798.</li>
    <li>Also, the number of females who bought TM798 and who rated themselves as a 5 on the fitness scale vastly outnumbered the males when categorized with gender.</li>
    <li>There were no instances of customers who rated themselves as 1 or 2 on the fitness scale who bought a single TM798.</li>

### Observations
<ol>
    <li>Male and female customers who had higher incomes preffered product TM798.</li>
    <li>The difference in the median income of the male customers who bought TM798 as compared to the TM195 and TM498 products was approximately 30,000 dollars. </li>

### Observations
<ol>
    <li>There are very few outliers as well as scatter in the regression plots</li>
    <li>There is a correlation relationship between age and income for all 3 products. So as age of the customer increases,the income slightly increases. </li>
    <li>For product TM798, the correlation for female customers with respect to age and income is higher than the correlation for the males.However, we have to keep in mind, that the number of points for male customers for TM798 is dispropotionaly higher than females.</li>
    </ol>

![image](https://github.com/deevikram/Exploratory_Data_Analysis/assets/83994337/ed82dfac-03e5-4467-abc1-70aadd149aab)

### Observations
<p> From the pair plots, we can confirm the observation that age and income, age and miles, income and miles have a correlation relationship.</p>

### Summary of key observations for the cardioFitness dataset
<ol>
    <li> Overall, male customers outnumbered female customers for buying treadmills.</li>
    <li> Younger customers (approximately in their 20s) with income in the lower half bought more treadmills when compared to older customers.</li>
    <li> Customers who had a partner bought more treadmills than single customers in the dataset. </li>
    <li> People who rated themselves to be in excellent shape bought more treadmills than people who rated themselves poorly on the fitness scale</li>
    <li> From the data of 180 customers, females above the age of 30 rated themselves lower on the fitness scale</li>
    <li> From the data of 180 customers, higher income and highly educated people rated themselves higher on the self-fitness scale.</li>
    <li> The product that had been bought by most number of customers was TM195.</li>
    <li> TM798 was prefered by people who rated themselves in excellent shape, and higher incomes and were highly educated. While the total number of male customers for product TM798 outnumbered the female customers, the product was bought by more number of female customers who rated themselves in excellent shape as compared to females who rated themselves lower on the fitness scale.</li>
    <li> People who rated themselves higher on the fitness scale, also expected to use the treadmill for more number of times per week, and walk/run more miles as compared to people who rated themselves lower on the fitness scale.</li>
    </ol>

  <ol>
    <li> TM195 is a very popular product (compared to TM498 and TM798). Since it is bought by single males, partnered  females and with customers who have incomes less than 60,000 dollars - it is likely that this is a product that has an affordable price that has a wider reach. </li>
    <li> TM798 is a product that can be said to appeal to higher income, highly educated males and females who rate themselves higher on the fitness scale. It is possible that the driver here is the price and the adveritzing as a "niche" product. </li>
    <li> Overall, the biggest customer base are the people with incomes in the 44,000 - 58,000 dollar range.</li></ol>

  ### 10. Recommendations that can be made based on the data analysis
